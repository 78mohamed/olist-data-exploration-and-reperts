# olist-data-exploration-and-reperts
In this project we explored olist dataset using sql server then transformed it into star schema to be more suitable for analisis
I intigrated olist data with adventure  work using ssis bot the analysis and the report was done only using olist dataset
using ssas we made cubes to make it easier for analysis and visualization on both ssrs and power bi.
